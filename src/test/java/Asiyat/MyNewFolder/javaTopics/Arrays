Normally, an array is a collection of similar type of elements that have a contiguous memory location.

Java array is an object which contains elements of a similar data type. It is a data structure where we store similar elements. We can store only a fixed set of elements in a Java array.

Array in java is index-based, the first element of the array is stored at the 0 index.
